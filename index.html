            <h3>Build Climber and Train Stopper</h3>

            <p>WordPress Enthusiastic and, Open Source Lover. I also assist in designing, developing and testing
                websites
                too!</p>

            <p>I love to contribute to the WordPress Community. I am always happy to meet new peoples in the WordPress
                community and see how I can help them achieve their goals. When I am not online and WordPress, I love to
                play football, travel, riding the bike and attend Meetup/WordCamps!</p>

            <p>Over the last few years, I learned web programming and worked with them locally. Before coming to web
                programming I was mostly involved with Electric Media(Channel i), Newspaper (Priyo, Bhorer Kagoj) and
                volunteering activities (including NGOs).</p>
